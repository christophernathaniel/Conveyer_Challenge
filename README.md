<h1>Conveyer Belt Challenge</h1>

<h2>The challenge</h2>

See the challenge notes in this repository.

This is a coding challenge for a conveyer belt. There is a factory production line around a single conveyor belt. Components (of type A and B) come onto the start of the belt at random intervals; workers must take one component of each type.

<h2>The solution</h2>
This is an Example of a Conveyer Coding challenge solution.

The concept of this solution is broken down in to a few basic steps. This includes basic testing to test the conveyer-belt logic.

<ul>
<li>Create a Heartbeat, the concept of time.</li>
<li>Assign a worker to a slot in the conveyer-belt.</li>
<li>Allow the conveyer-belt to contain objects with an assigned value.</li>
<li>Allow the worker to choose how it wishes to interact with the conveyer-belt.</li>
<li>Allow the worker to process a slot on the conveyer belt.</li>
<li>Allow the worker to stop processing items from the conveyer belt, and have a seperate process that can occure when conditions are met.</li>
<li>Run tests to ensure the logics are correct.</li>
</ul>
